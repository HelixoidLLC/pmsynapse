I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore and analyze the pmsynapse codebase. I've got the project context loaded - it's a comprehensive AI-enabled project management system built with Rust + Tauri + React.\n\nI'm in read-only mode, so I can search through files, read code, and analyze patterns, but I can't make any changes. I'm optimized to:\n\n- Find files quickly using glob patterns\n- Search code with powerful regex\n- Analyze file contents and architecture\n- Work efficiently across the monorepo structure\n\nWhat would you like me to explore or find in the codebase?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":4685,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":141,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CW3SwcDdYemkxpCbhvJHG","type":"assistant","uuid":"b3237efe-0c9d-4cfb-8d34-aa30e6a0d2c1","timestamp":"2025-12-12T20:46:41.521Z"}

00:00:00.160 Hey everybody, my name is Brian and I am the creator of the BMAD method. This is going to be a long video, but I want to
00:00:06.799 show everything involved with using Claude Code, all the agents, all the options, all within the IDE. This is the
00:00:13.840 first time I've done this, and I want to show you so many details and just how cool some of these features are that I've never demonstrated before in a
00:00:20.480 video. And I've never seen anybody else show some of these techniques also. But there are chapters here, so feel free to
00:00:26.400 jump ahead to the chapter that you need. But honestly, I really suggest watching this through from beginning to end.
00:00:32.558 There's so much good information that I'm going to be sharing with you today that this is this is just going to be so
00:00:38.559 beneficial for you. You might not be using Claude Code, but there's going to be a ton of information in here. Trust
00:00:44.879 me when I say if you can follow this, this applies to all of the other IDEs.
00:00:50.000 So, install it for whatever IDE you want. A lot of what I'm going to be showing applies to all of them. Also,
00:00:56.640 please give it a thumbs up. It helps the channel. Subscribe, tell your friends.
00:01:02.000 Share this. Spread the word about this. So many people are using this in their day-to-day lives. Um, people tell me
00:01:09.119 every day they're using this at work. They're using it for so many different things that I never even imagined. Let's
00:01:14.400 dive right in. You always want to come to the BMAD method and see what's new. If you come to the BMAD method, this is
00:01:16.000 No text
00:01:20.479 also the easiest way to get started. And I really do suggest that you start out here. you can come to the read me and
00:01:27.200 you can see here's the link to the YouTube where I'll have this video and other tutorial videos posted. Also,
00:01:32.560 while you're here, if you're a fan of the BMAD method or if you try it out and enjoy it, I will say come up here to the
00:01:37.680 top and then over to the right of the sponsorship button. There's a star over here. Please click star. This helps
00:01:43.360 other people also find out about this project on GitHub when they're looking for agentic tools and helpers to help
00:01:49.520 take their vibe coding to the next level. And this is going to be showing you how to do a green field development
00:01:55.119 of a very simple to-do application. As always, I say take this method and make it your own. This is not meant to be the
00:02:02.079 only way to do it, but it is meant to give you a framework so you can mold it to your own way of working, your own
00:02:07.920 type of project. So, you'll want to subscribe to the channel, hit the notification bell so you know exactly when that video comes out. But first,
00:02:15.360 let's get to it, everybody. All right. So, aside from uh these links here, if you scroll right down in the read me,
00:02:21.000 No text
00:02:21.520 you're going to see this workflow user guide. This user guide is very simple to
00:02:26.640 follow. You can read this, but if you scroll down, look, there's two diagrams here, and they're very easy to follow.
00:02:32.319 This shows you exactly how to use the BMED method, whether you're doing it in the web or in the IDE of your choice.
00:02:39.440 First of all, you have a project idea in mind, right? You have two choices. You can use the analyst. The business
00:02:45.440 analyst is here to help you further refine your idea before you go to the PM
00:02:51.440 and start making your PRD. So, I'm going to show you how to install the VMAD method and actually get set up in cloud
00:02:57.280 code to start using the analyst. And I'm going to show you the optional brainstorming and then also how we
00:03:03.040 create a product brief which will then make the rest of the flow so much easier. And what's so exciting is you
00:03:10.000 can actually do everything with the BMAD method now all within cloud code, all within the IDE. So if you so choose, you
00:03:18.159 do not have to use the web and the full team stack anymore if you do not want to. I actually enjoy and have had great
00:03:24.959 success using the BMED method fully in the IDE and I'm going to show you how to do that today. Really quick though, we
00:03:31.680 have the analyst, right? And then it's going to go to the product manager which
00:03:36.799 we will then go to the PO and then we will come down to the
00:03:42.720 development phase. But take your time really understanding this. It might look complicated but it's actually a very
00:03:47.920 simple flowchart. This is if you want to use the BMAD method for a brownfield or green field development to take it from
00:03:54.560 ideation all the way to actually developing it in the code. Right now you see the only thing I have here is the
00:04:00.799 BMAD method. Now, you do not have you do not have to install the full GitHub repo
00:04:02.000 No text
00:04:06.480 BMED method locally. You will only clone that if you want to create your own
00:04:11.599 expansion packs or maybe make changes to the core system or contribute to the
00:04:16.720 project, which I would love by the way, but you don't need to do that. I'm going to show you how to use the BMAD method
00:04:22.479 in cloud code without even cloning the GitHub repo. So, first of all, let's um
00:04:29.440 create a project. But what we can do is from any directory. I suggest doing it from the dev directory. We are going to
00:04:35.600 type npx and then we're going to type bmad- method install. We are going to use the bad
00:04:42.639 method 4.33.1. We will just hit enter to accept that. Let's enter the full path
00:04:47.759 of our directory. Since we're in the dev folder, I'm just say dot meaning this folder. And then I'm going to say slash.
00:04:54.000 And now I'm going to put the name of the new directory that I want to create my project in. Since we're doing this from
00:04:59.360 scratch with no starter project, I'm just going to say simple
00:05:04.479 to-do. That's the name of our project. Just a very simple to-do application. And hit enter. It's fine if that
00:05:10.720 directory doesn't already exist. If you're doing this in a brownfield or if you already have started your project maybe with a template, you'll just give
00:05:17.680 it the directory to your project and it will add this to an existing project. So
00:05:23.360 then right here, this is a multi select, but we're just going to go with the default and select the BMAD core. The
00:05:29.280 BMAD core is the agile workflow AIdriven that we're showing here. So just hit
00:05:36.479 enter. And then we are going to shard the PRD, which means we're going to generate a large document, but then
00:05:43.280 we're going to split it up into smaller pieces. So just accept the default here. And then the same thing with the
00:05:48.400 architecture. The architecture file can be very large depending on what type of project you're building. And so you'll
00:05:54.400 want to shard the architecture into smaller documents and this is all automated. I will show how this works.
00:06:00.720 Um, but that is really going to help you maximize the context in your agents so
00:06:05.759 they only load what they need instead of having to load and read through a whole massive file. They'll know which files
00:06:11.600 they need in the moment to load and it will help them with their context. So we'll say yes to that. Now, here's a
00:06:18.240 warning and this is just pointing out this is also a multis select. You can select one or multiple IDEs that you
00:06:25.120 want to install to. For example, let's say that you are a fan of cursor and
00:06:30.319 cloud code. Well, you can hit spacebar and cursor and spacebar and cla code. Today, I'm just going to be doing this
00:06:36.639 in vanilla VS code. So, I am only going to be using cloud code. So, I have highlighted cloud code with the radio
00:06:42.720 button. Make sure that you actually spacebar to hit the radio button. And if you just highlight it like I have right
00:06:48.160 here right now and hit enter, this will actually not install it for any idees. Uh, one other quick tip is depending on
00:06:54.720 the size of your screen, you might not see all of these options here. So, just know that you can arrow up and down and
00:07:00.720 more options will appear and we're constantly adding more idees for support here. Hitting enter. And now this is
00:07:07.280 asking if we want to include the pre-built web bundles. The web bud the web bundles are not needed for working
00:07:13.919 in the IDE. This is kind of warning us in case we thought it existed and we
00:07:19.039 typed in the wrong directory. For example, you know, we could choose a different directory location or we could
00:07:24.160 cancel and start over. But in this case, we're going to say create the directory and continue.
00:07:29.759 Okay. So, if we scroll up here, we can see what did it do here. It installed some commands for cloud code. So, these
00:07:38.000 slash commands will be how we activate our different agents. And then we've also installed some commands and these
00:07:44.720 are great because sometimes we want to do something without necessarily invoking an agent. We are now done. That
00:07:50.880 is the install of the BMAD method. I know it took a few minutes to explain it because I was going through the options,
00:07:52.000 No text
00:07:56.720 but let's see how fast this literally is. I'm going to do it one more time. I'm going to do n px vad- method
00:08:07.360 install. And I'm just going to give this a different folder this time. So I'm just
00:08:12.560 going to say uh let's say dash demo one, right? Just demo one. Enter. Enter.
00:08:20.000 Enter. Enter. Select my IDE. Enter. Enter. Enter. Boom. That's done. 5
00:08:26.800 seconds and you're ready to go with the BMED method. It's really that simple. All right. And just to see that our two
00:08:32.559 projects are there. If we do ls, we can see that we do have the demo one, the one we just did, and also simple to-do.
00:08:38.958 Simple to-do is the project we're going to use. So, I'm just going to do rm-rf demo one. We do not need that anymore.
00:08:46.959 And now we can see that we have our simple to-do. So, I'm going to go into simple to-do
00:08:55.920 and I am just going to open up uh VS Code. Now, right now we have no project
00:09:00.000 No text
00:09:01.120 here, right? All we have is what we've installed for our agents under BMAD
00:09:07.839 and our custom tasks or commands for cloud code. And then we have the full
00:09:12.880 BMAD core system here. Before we go on, I do want to say one other thing though, and that is I want to thank everybody
00:09:19.279 that has actually taken the time to buy me a coffee. I've talked to a few of you
00:09:25.360 and just know how much it really means for supporting me and the BMED method
00:09:30.480 and the community here. So, I want to thank everybody that's come and supported the BMAD method. And if you
00:09:36.800 would like to uh you can go to buy me a coffee, look for BMAD code or the link in the description. Any amount helps and
00:09:43.760 I truly thank all of you. I like to use claude code in the terminal inside VS Code, but it doesn't matter if you use
00:09:50.640 claude code outside. You could use it inside the warp terminal or your own
00:09:55.920 external terminal, uh, you know, T-Max or anything, whatever you want to use, but I just find it convenient to kind of
00:10:02.320 keep it all in here. It's easy to, you know, just have the, uh, keyboard shortcut to show and hide the terminal.
00:10:08.640 Um, but we have no other project, right? So, as always, if you've used cloud code, you should know how to do this.
00:10:14.240 You just want to type claude. And we are going to launch Claude Code. Of course, you will have to have
00:10:20.480 installed Claude Code and set up your authentication, but I'm assuming you've done that. If not, go to the Cloud Code
00:10:26.640 website, see how to install it, figure out whether you're going to do the $20 plan on the 100 or the 200, and then
00:10:33.360 you're ready to go. Oh, by the way, I have been talking to a lot of people that have just been using the $20
00:10:39.440 version of Claude Code. If you're fine not having the sonnet, excuse me, the
00:10:44.720 opus model, the $20 clog code will actually get you very far depending on how much you're doing. Uh, so just say
00:10:51.279 yes, we do trust this folder. This is the first time we've opened this in a project. You could run the slashinit
00:10:57.680 command, but I'm not going to do that yet cuz there's not really anything in this project for it to know about. After
00:11:03.440 we build a little bit of our project and get some stuff in place, that's when I would do clait. Well, if we go back to
00:11:09.839 the diagram, we can see that the first person or the
00:11:15.920 first agent that we want to talk to is the analyst because we're going to do some brainstorming. And if you just hit
00:11:20.959 slash, if you selected cloud code in the installation, you're going to see all
00:11:26.560 these all these options here. And if you don't want to arrow through this list, what you can do is you can just start
00:11:31.760 typing the part of the name of the agent that you want. So, for example, analyst,
00:11:38.800 you can just start typing it like that and it will highlight it. Or if you know what it is, you can just
00:11:45.760 type the whole thing or you can arrow up and down to the one that you're looking for. So, here's the analyst. So, we're
00:11:50.880 going to select it. This is how simple it is to use clawed code with the BMED method. You saw it takes 5 seconds to
00:11:57.680 install, maybe 10 seconds if you want to read everything. So, this is Mary, our business analyst. I know a lot of people
00:12:04.560 think the power in the BMED method is in the development of actual code,
00:12:12.320 but I think Mary the business analyst is probably the most special agent in the
00:12:18.560 whole BBA method. If you are just trying to think of something to build or maybe
00:12:24.399 you have a little bit of an idea, I really strongly suggest that you try
00:12:29.760 using this business analyst with the brainstorming method. This goes beyond software development. You can use this
00:12:30.000 No text
00:12:37.279 for any type of brainstorming, whether it be in your day job or, you know, life questions. I've tried many different
00:12:44.320 brainstorming tools, including professional brainstorming tools that have been developed by Google. For
00:12:51.200 example, in the Gemini gems, there is a default brainstorming gem that you can use. It's it's nothing like this. So,
00:12:58.480 you know, let's let's do that. So, we're talking to Mary right now. Mary is active. As always, you can do star help.
00:13:04.480 And so, now these are all of the different things that are available to you. Now you can either select a number
00:13:11.760 or you can type out the name of the command or you can rely on the fuzzy
00:13:17.360 matching and usually the LLM will get it right. So I'm just going to select
00:13:22.399 number five though which means brainstorm and I'm not going to give it a topic. I'm just going to say number
00:13:27.920 five. Even though Cloud Code supports a context window that seems to allow you
00:13:33.279 to go on and on and on without ever getting close to compaction, that doesn't mean you should. So, when we're
00:13:40.639 done with the analyst brainstorming, it will give us a brainstorming document. It will save it to a folder called Docs,
00:13:48.720 I will start a new chat. I like to start a new chat every time I have an output
00:13:53.920 document, then I'm ready to go. So, even if I'm going to talk to the same agent, I will clear Claude or start a new Cloud
00:14:00.560 session and then reload that agent and start going. So, here we go though. We're going with uh Mary and first she's
00:14:07.760 going to ask us four questions. So, we are going to use our Super Whisper. What
00:14:12.800 What is this brainstorming about? I would like to create a simple to-do app to demonstrate the BMAD method. So, this
00:14:19.040 should be a very simple NodeJS background application. But what I really want to brainstorm about is some
00:14:26.320 of the ideas we can do to at least make it a little bit interesting. So let's play some of your brainstorming games
00:14:32.240 and see what we can come up with. So we'll let it spit all that out. So question two, are there any constraints
00:14:37.279 or parameters that I should know about? Well, I already mentioned that we're using Node.js and I want this to be a very simple, straightforward small
00:14:44.160 project just to demonstrate the BMAD method with Node.js and TypeScript and then we will submit that. So this is how
00:14:50.480 you work with the agent. One of the magical things about the BBN method is it not it is not just like a taskmaster
00:14:56.880 or some of these other things where you just throw out your idea and then it does all the thinking and working for you. As a matter of fact, what you're
00:15:02.880 going to see with this brainstorming is it is actually going to push on you to
00:15:08.079 get your ideas out. It is going to be your coach. So that is what is special about this. It is not checking your
00:15:14.320 brain at the door and doing it all for you. It is going to work with you and
00:15:20.160 it's going to bring the best out of both of you. The BMAD method, by the way, is all about elevating yourself, learning,
00:15:28.000 and also elevating the LLM. So, as a whole, you are both better collectively
00:15:33.360 than each one on its own. That is the special sauce of the BMED method. That's that's the secret everybody. Are we
00:15:39.600 aiming for broad exploration of possibilities or more focused ideiation? Let's go broad. Let's go crazy. I want
00:15:45.760 to show just what you are capable of as the amazing brainstorming agent that you
00:15:50.800 are. Nothing wrong with flattering your LLM every once in a while. They're sure going to do it to you. Yes, definitely.
00:15:58.399 And that is also the default. But when we're done here, this will take all of our brainstorming and give us this
00:16:03.759 amazing artifact. This is one of the coolest artifacts in one of the most recent additions to the BMAD method.
00:16:10.160 This was not even in the original release of V4. I thought this would be a V5 thing, but I love the brainstorming
00:16:17.279 document output, and I think you'll love it, too. We haven't gotten to the brainstorming yet, but here we go. You
00:16:22.320 have four options here again. So, you can pick the techniques, and there's a whole list of 20 brainstorming
00:16:27.680 techniques built into the BMED method, or you can let the agent recommend it based on your project. Or you can do
00:16:34.320 random creative chaos. This one is fun. You never know what it's going to get, but sometimes it picks some of the
00:16:39.680 wackiest ones. or the progressive creative journey where we start super broad with wild what if type scenarios
00:16:46.240 and there's five of those and then gradually go down to focus. I just want
00:16:52.079 to show you all of the different options that we have here. So let's go to number one this time. All right, so here we go.
00:16:57.440 You can see that there's quite a few here and there's actually more coming in the future. So we have what if
00:17:02.880 scenarios, analogical thinking, reversal inversion, first principles thinking,
00:17:08.079 structured frameworks such as the scamper method, the six thinking hats,
00:17:13.359 mind mapping, collaborative techniques such as from the improv world, there's yesand, there's brainwriting, roundroin,
00:17:20.400 random stimulation. There's deep exploration with the five W's, a classic brainstorming technique to really do a
00:17:26.959 root cause analysis. There is morphological analysis, advanced techniques such as forced relationships,
00:17:34.240 assumption reversal, role- playinging, timeshifting, resource constraints, metaphor mapping, questiontorming. But
00:17:41.280 with the power of the BMAD agent, Mary here, she's going to guide you through these and help you come up with stuff
00:17:47.120 that you never even probably imagined. You're going to see how with brainstorming, we can even make a to-do
00:17:52.160 list super interesting and exciting. If we would have selected one of the other techniques up here, those also involve
00:18:00.400 multiple selections from here and it will work through each of them one at a
00:18:05.520 time. Usually 10 to 15 minutes is what it takes for each one. So this can be a
00:18:10.559 lengthy process, but look, if you're at the beginning of embarking on a really large project or you have some ambitious
00:18:16.559 ideas, it is worth doing this brainstorming to really come up with,
00:18:21.679 you know, super creative just interesting ideas. take the time here to build for the future. Let's just pick a
00:18:28.000 couple. Somebody in the community was suggesting that they would love to see six thinking hats and also the five W's
00:18:36.400 built into the BMAD method. And then they realized that they were actually already in here. So just for them, I'm
00:18:43.760 going to select number six, the five W's. So we'll do 11. Uh let's do role playing. Role playing's always fun. So
00:18:51.360 now the agent will remember our choices and it's going to work with us one at a time. And remember here, we are not
00:18:57.360 asking Mary to brainstorm and come up with this for us. She's going to guide us through this exercise. This is your
00:19:04.000 own personal coach to brainstorm on complex, creative, or interesting ideas.
00:19:11.200 Folks, this is worth I don't even know what. You know, you can pay experts to teach you how to brainstorm or be your
00:19:17.840 brainstorming coach and it's going to cost you thousands of dollars and you're getting this for free and we're doing
00:19:23.039 all of this in claude code. So, this is amazing. So, okay, what do we got here? Well, excellent choice. So, first we're
00:19:28.480 going to start with the first selection number six, which was the six thinking hats, five ways, and then roleplaying.
00:19:35.919 This is going to generate some seriously creative ideas. And again, this does not have to be about apps. You can brainstorming about everything. Maybe
00:19:42.320 you want to brainstorm ideas for a vacation or brainstorm how you're going to retire in 10 years or brainstorm, you
00:19:50.400 know, what you should do with your life or how you should unscrew up something in your life. I mean, this can be used
00:19:57.280 for anything. It is amazing. But, okay, so what are we going to do here? White hat. So, the six hats, there's going to
00:20:04.080 be six different colored hats. So, the first hat is the white hat. What factual elements could make your to-do app
00:20:09.840 interesting from a technical data perspective? So, think about it. What
00:20:15.360 kind of data could it track? What metrics, what information could it
00:20:20.400 capture that most to-do apps ignore? So, I would have never asked myself that question on my own. And I'm already
00:20:26.960 thinking now, wow, I was just thinking a simple to-do app from the white hat perspective. It's now getting me to
00:20:32.559 think about some really interesting aspects of a to-do app. So again, there's no right or wrong answer and I
00:20:38.720 don't even know if I'm going to come up with anything interesting. This is not the actual product that we're going to create. We're just throwing ideas out
00:20:44.640 there. When we get the report at the end of all of this, it's going to help us distill down what is interesting to then
00:20:51.039 go to the next agent with. I think it could track how much time elapses
00:20:56.159 between when they enter a to-do and when they mark it done. Also, it would be interesting to correlate the length or
00:21:03.679 size of to-dos and the complexity of the to-dos and how that affects how soon the
00:21:10.000 to-dos get done. I love using Super Whisper, by the way, or Whisper Flow or one of the other many voice to text
00:21:16.799 ones. So, I'm just going to say yes. And one nice thing about working with clawed code in the IDE is that as you work
00:21:24.720 through each section of whatever whatever document you're working on, it will start creating the document for
00:21:30.400 you. So you don't have to worry about being lost if you if you lose the chat,
00:21:35.520 for example. I know sometimes there's anxiety when working with the web agents that you might lose it and it's hard to
00:21:41.360 get the full document out, but here you're building up the document as you go. And we already have our brainstorming sessions here now. Not too
00:21:47.520 worried about what's in there yet. We're just going to keep going. So now we've gone to the second hat. This is the yellow hat. Optimistic benefits. So look
00:21:54.320 friends. Um this would take too long to go through all of the brainstorming. So I'm going to go through all three brainstorming techniques. All right. And
00:22:00.000 No text
00:22:00.080 look at this. We got our brainstorming session complete. We did all three exercises. Let's now look at the
00:22:05.280 document that it produced. So we will go to open preview. This is actually going to give us the output and keep a record
00:22:10.559 of the brainstorming that we did. So first we did six thinking hats. critical concerns, creative alternatives, and we
00:22:17.520 found some fun ones in there. And then we went into process control. So, it really got me thinking about a lot of
00:22:22.799 different interesting things. This led to so many different things. Then we did the five W's. The five W's was a lot of
00:22:28.320 fun. The first why is why is complexity completion correlation valuable? And then I gave it an answer. And the answer
00:22:35.280 was because people consistently underestimate how long complex tasks take. And the way the five W's works is
00:22:42.400 then it's going to say okay well why does that or why is that the case and then I gave an answer and then it's
00:22:47.760 gonna say well why is that the case why is that it's a way to really dig down in
00:22:52.880 a somewhat annoying way but it's kind of fun doing it with the AI so then we get into technique three which is role
00:22:58.400 playing this is one of my favorite because the AI will just invent some
00:23:03.760 sort of role playing and you never know what it's going to give you so here I came up with the overwhelmed freelancer
00:23:09.200 the context is You're juggling 12 clients, 47 open tasks. You have a
00:23:14.640 current to-do app, multiple of them, making matters worse. So, how do we triage intelligence? Show me what
00:23:21.440 actually needs to happen today versus what I think needs to happen. Client workload balance, visual dashboard
00:23:28.240 showing task distribution across clients to prevent overcommitment. Imagine the project that you really want to launch
00:23:34.480 in the market and what this brainstorming agent can do for you. This is next effing level. Okay. And then it
00:23:42.799 gave us more because I wanted to do more brainstorming. So, we didn't just start with the overland free overwhelmed freelancer. We talked about the
00:23:49.760 perfectionist student and what they would get out of a to-do app, the executive assistant, the ADHD creative.
00:23:56.960 So, I wouldn't have even necessarily thought of all those personas. uh the analyst Mary helped me come up with
00:24:02.720 these different role playinging scenarios and we talked back and forth and then it gives us an executive summary because okay so it's great so we
00:24:09.200 did all those things we're not going to use all of that right it then we kind of talked about what was important to me and I kind of like gave it some of the
00:24:15.440 key insights and we came up with some of these key insights together transforming from task management to behavioral
00:24:21.039 intelligence your simple to-do app becomes a personal productivity research lab that helps users understand their
00:24:27.039 actual work patterns versus their assumptions Tell me that is not powerful. And that
00:24:32.720 is again just from like let's brainstorm about a to-do app and this is what we came up with together. And now here's
00:24:38.480 what's really cool is it breaks it down into what can we do right now? What might we want to research and do in the
00:24:44.880 future and then what are like the moonshots or just the creative ambitious things we want to do later. And again
00:24:51.200 this could be like any aspect of your life. So use this use this in your
00:24:56.240 personal life use it for work. You can see now just how powerful the BMAD method is and you don't even need to be
00:25:02.559 in the web. We're doing this all with cloud code. And as a matter of fact, this is just on the cheapest model for
00:25:07.600 claude code. If I do slashmodel, you can see that I'm just using sonnet.
00:25:12.960 I'm not using opus and I'm not using the default. I'm just keeping it on set. You'll learn over time which model to
00:25:19.120 use. It's kind of an intuition that you'll develop. And trust me, even if you don't consider yourself a strong
00:25:24.880 developer or if you're new to this, you'll pick it up. You'll understand. It's it becomes very intuitive to know
00:25:31.279 which model to use. So, I would recommend though just so you can learn that. Keep it on sonnet for most things.
00:25:38.880 We are done with this. We've saved everything to a document. This is the most important thing with the workflow
00:25:44.640 in cloud code or really any agentic IDE that you're using. we are going to start
00:25:50.240 a new task with either the same agent or a new agent. So what are we going to do? We're going to stop clear the context or
00:25:57.360 if you don't want to clear the context and keep that conversation history for later, we'll just kill the window, start
00:26:03.600 a new one, and restart Claude. Now, you might not know this if you haven't used Claude before. Let's say we close this
00:26:09.919 and then we realize, oh, we're not done with the conversation that we were just in. If you hit slash and just hit the up
00:26:16.320 arrow a few times or type slashres, you can now see the chat that we were in
00:26:22.159 here before. So if you've had multiple chats, you'll see a list here. There's only one right now. If you highlight one
00:26:28.159 in blue in this theme, if your theme, it might be a different color. And now we're back in the chat that we were. So
00:26:34.480 that is how you get back to a previous chat. But we want to start a new chat. So again, I'm going to just close that.
00:26:40.320 I could have done slashcle, but I want to retain it. So, I'm just going to do cloud again. And now we're going to start a new chat. Now, we're still going
00:26:47.200 to talk to the analyst in this case. And now I want to show you how to talk to the analyst to do basically the most
00:26:54.799 important thing out of the analyst that you really want is the project brief. Uh, by the way, the analyst is a totally
00:27:00.880 optional thing. You don't have to do brainstorming. You don't have to do a project brief. It is something that you can do. Again, it really depends on the
00:27:07.760 complexity of your project and how much you already know. If you if if we were just doing the simplest to-do app, I
00:27:14.000 No text
00:27:14.159 would go right to the PM, create a PRD for a simple to-do app. You can go right from PRD with its epics and stories
00:27:21.200 directly to development. I will show all of that in the A to B full walkth through, but right now I just want to
00:27:27.919 continue showing you this basic path of using cloud code. So, we're going to select number two right now. And this is
00:27:32.960 now going to help us create a project brief. And you'll see right there it loaded elicitation methods. That is one of the other big awesome things that's
00:27:41.039 built into the BMED method. The BMAD method is built up of YAML templates which have two things. Basically, the
00:27:47.679 outline of the type of document, but more importantly, and this is what makes it, I think, more powerful than any
00:27:54.080 other method I've seen so far, but other people are starting to catch on to these ideas. Embedded in the template is
00:28:01.039 instructions for the LLM and how it should work with you. Because as I said a little bit ago, the beauty of the BMAD
00:28:07.919 method is not that you ask it for something and it spits out a whole document, but that it really works back
00:28:13.679 and forth with you coming up with the best possible thing that you guys can come up with together. So, first it's
00:28:20.159 asking, do we already have any existing brainstorming results? Market research. Sometimes it's best to look out in the
00:28:26.720 marketplace, see what's out there, and build your own version of it, maybe with your own twist. It's a big market out
00:28:32.880 there. So don't feel like you always have to be the first to market with anything. So maybe you want to do market
00:28:38.000 research and see what is out there or do a competitive analysis and see what your competitors are doing differently. But
00:28:44.240 what we're going to do is we're just going to take our brainstorming. We're going to drop it here and say here's our
00:28:49.279 brainstorming session results. We can use this to kickstart our work in interactive mode in creating the project
00:28:56.799 brief. You don't have to use these exact words by the way. So don't don't you don't have to memorize the exact words.
00:29:02.080 Talk to this as if you were talking to your business analyst. Now this is going to kickstart it. So the nice thing here too is we started a new chat, but you're
00:29:08.799 seeing because we saved it to a document. I'm able to use a brand new context. It's not getting polluted. It
00:29:15.120 only has the output from the brainstorming session. And so it just keeps it lean. And so now it's going to
00:29:20.559 ask us some questions. It's going to pull things out of our brainstorming and probably get us through the PRD a little
00:29:28.399 bit quicker than normal because you can see here, for example, it already knows what the executive summary is because we've told it when we were doing the
00:29:35.120 brief. I am only going to show this first section and then I'm going to finish the document and then we'll move
00:29:40.480 on to the PM. What you can see is after you complete the executive summary, this is just one part of the overall brief by
00:29:46.720 the way. It already figured some stuff out from our previous brainstorming. we can correct it or we can tell it to change things. So, you'll want to read
00:29:52.640 this and obviously work with it. But at the end of each section, you're going to have multiple options. These are called
00:29:59.200 advanced elicitations. Whether you're working with the PM or the architect or the business analyst right here, every
00:30:06.480 section of a document, most of them will ask you different advanced elicitations related to the document you're working
00:30:12.799 on. Now, unlike brainstorming where it's asking you, the user questions, this is
00:30:18.559 where another powerful aspect of the BMAD method kicks in, and I haven't talked a lot about this before, so this
00:30:24.000 is very important, but this is where you push on the LLM to do better. When you talk to any LLM, whether you're just
00:30:30.240 using the BMAD method or not, or you're just using Chat TBT, if you picture a bell curve, you know, you're kind of
00:30:35.760 getting the average slice of the entire, you know, corpus of information in the
00:30:41.520 LLM. It's giving you the average response. It's, you know, not necessarily great. It's not necessarily
00:30:47.360 weak. The advanced solicitation is your chance to really stick the cattle prod to the agent and say, "Do better. Make
00:30:54.399 sure that you have put this through the fire and you're giving me the best possible result." Challenge the scope.
00:30:59.440 We can force it to brainstorm. So, just like it was having us brainstorm, we can now turn the torture back around on the
00:31:05.039 LLM and have it brainstorm different ideas. There's actually many more advanced elicitations. Again, just so it
00:31:11.679 doesn't overwhelm you, it's just giving some of them. Please do number four and number five. And by the way, while we're
00:31:18.159 waiting for that, notice that it did already start our brief. This is our project brief. So again, the beauty of
00:31:23.679 doing this in the IDE with cloud code is that we are generating the documents as
00:31:29.840 we go. But first, it did critical assumption testing. So, it's basically, by the way, this is
00:31:36.320 just another great thing to do with any product idea that you have. And so, I
00:31:41.440 love that the LLM thought about this. Look at all of your ideas for your product and really stress test them and
00:31:48.880 make sure that they make sense, especially if you want to build an MVP first to just get something to market.
00:31:54.960 And then we also did explore alternative solution approaches. So at the very end of it, it kind of synthesizes everything
00:32:01.200 and it gives some recommendations based on what it was doing with itself right there. Sure. This is just a demo. So
00:32:07.519 we're just going to apply them all, update the section, and then we'll move on to the next section of the product
00:32:12.799 brief. Let me say please uh subscribe to the channel if you're enjoying this. So much more content is coming out, my
00:32:18.080 friends. You know, I know these videos don't come out as often as I would like to because I'm also constantly working
00:32:23.200 on actually improving the BMED method. I'm not here to just hype up new things, new products, or, you know, even tell
00:32:29.679 you I'm using this, but I do want to be able to use this forum or this platform to share the changes with you. But also,
00:32:37.039 I spent a lot of time actually working on this. But subscribe to the channel, hit that notification bell so you do know when the next one comes out because
00:32:43.039 it is a little sporadic sometimes. And join us in the Discord. I'm going to finish this up. We will look at the
00:32:48.799 whole product brief when it's done, and then we'll move on to the product manager. All right. So, I'm going to pick up the pace here a little bit. We
00:32:55.279 are done with the brief. We've gone through the whole thing. The brief is now ready for the PM handoff. So before
00:33:01.760 we do that, I just want to show here's our product brief. Since we're in cloud code and not in the web, it just keeps
00:33:07.600 updating the document for us. We have the executive summary, the problem statement, pain points, why we're doing
00:33:14.640 this, what is the proposed solution, the target users. So this says like the
00:33:19.760 demographics, who do we expect to be using this? Why would they use it? How are they each going to use it differently? And why is it valuable to
00:33:26.240 them? This is so important. If you're just wanting to put any kind of product
00:33:31.600 in the market and you're just thinking you're just going to vibe vibe code something, throw it out there and be an
00:33:37.279 overnight millionaire. Maybe you will be, but you have to consider all these things. You have to
00:33:43.600 understand the target audience that you're looking for. So that's the beauty of this product brief. It's going to really help you figure out a lot of that
00:33:49.919 and make sure you're building something that makes sense or might indicate that you want to pivot on something because
00:33:55.600 it's not actually going to achieve what you want to achieve. Why waste a lot of money, effort, and time building
00:34:00.960 something that's not going to go anywhere when instead you can do this little bit of research up front, right?
00:34:06.640 So, we're showing this this whole document. The point of the product brief is to really work back and forth with it
00:34:13.359 and produce this document that helps you understand what it is you're going to build at a most fundamental level. As
00:34:19.839 always, what did I say? Even in cloud code, even though we could go on and on and probably talk to three agents in a
00:34:25.839 row without running out of context, we're still going to start a new one. So again, we can just kill it and start a
00:34:31.839 new cloud session. I'm going to show you a different way this time and that is just slashcle
00:34:38.000 and this is going to clear the conversation history and free up the context is it's it's basically the same
00:34:43.839 thing. You could also do compact. I do not recommend it. And if you ever see your IDE is showing you the warning that
00:34:50.480 you're almost ready to start compaction. That means that means you've been in the chat for too long and you probably want
00:34:56.879 to wrap up what you're doing. There's different techniques for what you for that to get out of there, but you
00:35:03.280 generally do not want to rely on compaction. It's just randomly going to forget
00:35:08.320 things that might be important. So, there's other techniques, but basically, if you follow my method and you just
00:35:13.760 switch and do clear, but sometimes you'll forget and all of a sudden you'll see that warning and then, you know, you
00:35:19.760 have to adapt. But let's um let's talk to the next agent. So if you don't know what agent to talk to, again,
00:35:26.640 you can go back to the diagram. So we've done this, right? So we we talked to the analyst. We've done our optional
00:35:32.000 No text
00:35:33.440 brainstorming. We didn't do the optional market research or competitor analysis, but you can try those on your own. It
00:35:38.480 depends on what type of project, but we did create our project brief. So now we
00:35:44.000 are going to talk to the product manager. And if we have a product brief,
00:35:49.680 we're going to give it to the product manager. it will actually ask us. So, I mentioned you might have a similar pro or a simpler project. And if you do or
00:35:57.599 you already know what you want to do, maybe you even already have a product brief, you can just talk to the PM and
00:36:04.160 it will just ask you more questions if you don't provide the brief. But if you provide the if you provide the brief, it
00:36:10.079 kind of gives it a kickstart and it will get the PRD done much quicker. But it
00:36:15.119 just depends what you want to work. Again, if you're just doing a simple app, you don't have to go through all of this. just go right to the PM, create
00:36:21.280 the PRD, even tell it you want it to be a technical PRD with architecture built
00:36:26.640 into it. You'll be coding in no time. So there's multiple flows and workflows and ways you can work this system. But
00:36:33.280 again, come back to this diagram if you're not sure. So let's go back to cloud code. So now again, I hit slash
00:36:39.200 here. We could just type PM. That'll take us right to it. If we're not sure, we can also just kind of look through
00:36:44.880 here and then arrow on it. The product manager is going to basically create a
00:36:50.000 PRD which is a product requirements doc. Building a PRD is important and also I'll say the three most important things
00:36:55.920 with this PRD is first of all it's going to give us all the functional and non-functional requirements and the epic
00:37:02.720 that is made up to meet all of those. So right there we can see everything that
00:37:09.440 is going to be encompassed by the build that we're planning here. Secondly, it's going to help work with
00:37:15.359 us to figure out what is in scope for the MVP and what we can potentially pull out to have post MVP. Because if you can
00:37:22.640 make your app the simplest version of the app that you can make that will meet
00:37:28.320 the initial goal, that's less risk, less investment in a product. Maybe you want
00:37:33.440 to get it out there with just a minimum set of features to test it in the market. That's why you want to build an
00:37:38.480 MVP or minimum viable product. what is the basic thing of this core? But the PM
00:37:45.760 here will also capture your other ideas and if they're not part of the MVP, we'll still hold on to those and those
00:37:51.839 will be post MVP epics that you might do after the main build. So again, what is most important here? It helps us
00:37:58.400 maintain MVP scope. It gives us the functional and non-functional requirements with the epics. And then
00:38:04.320 the the third most important thing, but really kind of the key to the whole BMAD method is in those epics, it is going to
00:38:09.599 create the user stories, but more specifically, it knows that we are
00:38:14.880 creating these for very, very dumb developer agents. Now, as I've said all
00:38:20.320 along with the BMED method, you cannot just check your brain out and leave it at the door and rely on it 100%. Right?
00:38:26.480 So, we will use the advanced elicitation. We will read the information ourselves
00:38:31.920 and logically think to yourselves, does the story sequence make sense. If you
00:38:37.200 don't see a story, for example, that says scaffold and you know, set up your
00:38:42.240 project or set up your accounts or whatever you need, you know there's a problem and something's been missed, right? And usually that should be the
00:38:47.680 first one like project setup. You know, learn to kind of spot those things as you go. And there's also some advanced elicitations that will help us discover
00:38:54.160 that. So, let's move on here. So, we are just going to do create PRD. And I want to show you before we've been doing the
00:38:59.520 number, we can also just say star and we can actually just give it the command
00:39:04.720 name also or you could even speak it. Uh do notice that there are two Yep. There's two different PRDs here. There's
00:39:10.000 No text
00:39:11.119 the regular PRD and then there's the brownfield PRD. Brownfield is a term
00:39:18.240 that you will hear and you'll also hear green field. And I realize some people don't know what that means. So I want to
00:39:23.359 explain it and it's very simple. Green field means like you're looking out on a clean green pasture. It's all open.
00:39:31.839 Pretty much sky's is the limit. It's going to be easy to build your foundation. Nothing is there. Nothing in
00:39:37.760 is in the way. A brownfield is where all the has flowed. It's a cesspool.
00:39:44.800 Maybe it's an existing application that's existed for months or years or it was developed by other people. Maybe you
00:39:52.560 understand it. maybe it has a lot of issues in there. If you're going to work with something
00:39:57.760 like that, then you'll want to follow the path create brownfield and that will have a few more steps in it to also
00:40:03.440 provided the context of the existing application that you might be working on. Number two, we're just going to do a
00:40:09.680 regular PRD. Now, the PM is asking us, okay, do we
00:40:14.880 have the product brief to create the PRD? So, again, this will kickstart us to the PRD. If you were starting here,
00:40:21.040 you would say no and you would just start asking its question or you could go back and do it. But we're just going
00:40:26.320 to drag it in because we do have the brief. And we'll say here you go, buddy.
00:40:33.040 There is a lot of overlap between the product brief and some of the sections of the PRD,
00:40:39.119 but it's really going to translate that from the language of the product brief into functional and non-functional
00:40:44.960 requirements and a few of the other details that we need in there. Okay. So, let's see what we got here. So, it gave
00:40:51.040 us some goals. So, it understands what we're trying to build, why we're building it. We got some detailed rationale here. Tradeoffs made, key
00:40:58.079 assumptions, and areas needing attention. We have options to do advanced solicitation. And
00:41:04.880 by the way, I love this. Just like before, as we produce our document, we are going to generate each section of
00:41:11.680 the document one at a time. So, it's always going to have access to everything it's done. It's going to he
00:41:17.040 keep kind of a cohesive vision of the document we're building and it's going to build it up section by section.
00:41:23.359 Beautiful. I love this. Now we are doing section two. We moved on to the next section. So this is the requirements. So
00:41:28.960 this is going to give us the functional and non-functional requirements. Take your time and read through this. Again,
00:41:34.000 getting this right is important. And you really want to try to look, is there a
00:41:39.119 functional requirement here that you do need or don't need. I want to show you my absolute favorite advanced
00:41:45.200 elicitation to use here. Let's see if it suggests it. But I want to show you how you can actually find what other
00:41:51.599 advanced elicitations are available for the BMED method. But what you can do is you can go to data. We're going to go to
00:41:58.880 data and here are the elicitation methods. We can see them here. So there's explain reasoning, critique and
00:42:05.440 refine, analyze logical flow, assess alignment with overall goals, identify
00:42:10.880 potential risks, challenge from critical perspective, tree of thought, deep dives, hindsight is 2020, the if only
00:42:18.480 brainstorm, agile team perspective shift. This will take your different agents and have them all look at it from
00:42:24.880 a different perspective. It's a lot of fun. Uh stakeholder roundt, metaprompting analysis. So some of these
00:42:31.119 are very correct. uh very creative. Um and then we get into some of the new
00:42:36.400 advanced 2025 techniques that have been added in recently. Self-ont self-consistency validations, the rewoo,
00:42:44.079 which is reasoning without observation. I love that. Rewoo, persona pattern hybrid, emerging collaborative
00:42:50.480 discovery, red team versus blue team, innovative tournament, escape room challenge, proceed and no further
00:42:57.520 action. I want to tell you, I've done a lot of research into how to really
00:43:03.119 prompt engineer and get the most out of LLMs, and these are some of the best techniques that I've found from Google
00:43:10.160 and Anthropic. But I've also studied multiple prompting competitions where expert prompters just compete, and I see
00:43:17.599 a lot of them using some of these very cool techniques, and some of these are just crazy fun. So, let's let's pick a
00:43:24.079 let's pick a wild one. I like the what if if only hindsight is 2020. So what
00:43:29.680 I'm going to do is I'm going to just select this here. This is another thing you can do. Eventually these will all
00:43:35.119 just be in the menu at one time. Close this now.
00:43:42.000 This looks at all your functional and non-functional requirements and then it imagines that we've built the
00:43:48.000 application and that we're I don't know sometimes it does six months out sometimes it does a couple years out and
00:43:53.839 it's an analysis where the LLM does this conversation with itself reflecting on a
00:43:59.280 board meeting or something else where people are like if only we would have done this something would have happened.
00:44:05.520 So let's see what it did here. Imagine it's 6 months from now the MVP is launched. You're looking back at these
00:44:12.240 requirements. What if only statement might you be making? If only we had. If
00:44:18.880 only we had included basic team sharing features from the start. Non-functional requirement one might be unrealistic for
00:44:25.680 bootstrap budget and single developer. What if we hadn't promised cross device
00:44:30.800 sync and MVP? Functional requirement 7 adds significant technical complexity.
00:44:36.880 What if we started with single device and added sync in phase 2? So what's going on here? This is actually helping
00:44:42.720 you figure out how to cut scope out of your MVP. Keep it a lean lean build so
00:44:48.560 you can actually get something to market. Get it tested and then layer those features in later. This is the
00:44:54.800 real agile way of product development. Super powerful. So I'm going to say apply changes and update sections.
00:45:02.240 Revise the requirements based on these insights. Uh before you do that, you can talk to it. You can question different
00:45:08.079 things. You can tell it what you want to keep and not keep, but I'm just going to do number one for purposes of time. So,
00:45:14.160 I'm going to finish this and I'm going to get this up to the epics and stories and then we'll continue together. There's only one epic right now because
00:45:20.960 I told it just CRUD. So, foundation and core CRUD operation establish the project setup. As I said, always kind of
00:45:27.280 look out for that, right? Uh we are going to have local database. So, it'll do the database initialization and then
00:45:32.480 implement all basic to-do management commands. add, list, complete, delete, update, basic crud. So, since there's
00:45:40.480 only one epic, it's going to go right into the stories here. So, epic foundation and core. You'd want to read
00:45:46.240 this. And as always, read the stories and acceptance criteria and think,
00:45:52.720 does it make sense? Is there something being called out that actually relies on something later? This is great. This is
00:45:58.000 how agile actually works in story breakdown is each piece of functionality can kind of be its own standalone story.
00:46:04.960 Can we list and search for the to-dos? Can we mark a to-do done, delete a
00:46:10.560 to-do, update a to-do? You can also ask it questions if you don't see the one you want here and you don't want to
00:46:16.319 look. So, I'm going to tell a deep deep think please that the order and granularity of the stories actually make
00:46:22.160 sense. The sequencing must be perfect with no story dependent on a later story. It's checking to make sure that
00:46:28.640 they all follow the correct progression. You're absolutely right. Let's deeply analyze the story sequencing and
00:46:34.800 granularity as there are significant dependency issues in the current approach. So, do
00:46:40.319 we accept it? We'll say yes. So, does this sequencing now make sense? So, let's say yes. All right. So, looks like
00:46:48.160 Claude now thinks we have seven stories in perfect sequential order. Do we believe that? Well, don't check your
00:46:54.640 brain at the door. Let's close that though because we're done talking to the PM for now. But you do want to, you know, go through your doc. Imagine this
00:47:01.359 is a big ambitious project with multiple epics. Do you really just want to accept
00:47:06.480 some slop and move on and start developing? Maybe. But I would suggest
00:47:12.400 take your time and really understand and try to learn from this. Ask the LLM questions. The LLM is not going to
00:47:19.119 always tell you to do this. The reason we have agents and personas is because it's to help you also have a mental
00:47:26.000 model. Not not only does it help the agents perform better and keep focused
00:47:31.119 on their domain expertise and you know tailoring responses to that persona that
00:47:36.400 they're interacting, but it's also for you to understand that as they are
00:47:42.400 serving this role, talk to them as if they were in that role. So, you're talking to a product expert or an
00:47:48.640 architect or a scrum master. Ask them why they're choosing things. What do
00:47:54.240 different things mean? The beauty of this too is you don't have to be embarrassed about asking
00:48:00.079 questions. You can ask this what people might think is the dumbest question.
00:48:05.200 Look, maybe you don't know, maybe you've heard the word database before, but you don't even know what a database is.
00:48:12.240 Okay, you can Google it. It'll give you a definition, but you could also just ask why are you using a database for a
00:48:19.520 to-do app. It mentioned a name of a database. You could ask it why did you select this database? Why not something
00:48:25.920 else? And it'll give you an answer. So, you can learn a lot just by talking and at any time you can just ask the agent
00:48:33.119 questions about this document or any of the documents we're going to do. Now, we can start a brand new chat with the
00:48:40.079 architect. So, I'm going to open up Claude again. So, we're in the brand new cleared context. Nothing here. And if
00:48:47.200 you're not sure, you can always clear it again just to make sure. Now, we're going to do slashchitects.
00:48:54.079 Now, again, this is a very simple project. I would probably try to just go from PRD to stories. There is a workflow
00:49:00.880 that supports that, but I want to show you basically how the architect works. So, same thing. It'll either show you
00:49:07.440 the commands. If it doesn't, type starhelp and you can see what's available here. Now, here we have a
00:49:12.640 couple different architectures. Don't be confused, but it's pretty simple. You're either going to do a full stack
00:49:18.079 architecture, which is front end and backend, maybe is a monor repo, which
00:49:24.160 means all the code is in one project such as Nex.js, or maybe it is two separate repos and two separate
00:49:30.400 projects, React for your front end, and maybe a cloud service for your back end, and maybe in two different GitHub repos.
00:49:37.359 Um, you also might be starting with a starter project such as NECJ, Nex.js
00:49:44.640 with Superbase and Shad Saiyan and Tailwind. If you're doing that, you would want to generate your project, get
00:49:51.520 your boiler plate and share that with the PM or the architect. So, as they're
00:49:56.960 doing the architecture, they already know what you have, what your technologies are, what is in your
00:50:02.880 requirements.txt if you're doing Python or your package.json JSON if you're doing TypeScript or JavaScript, Node.js,
00:50:10.640 excuse me. Create full stack architectures if you're doing front-end back end. Create backend architectures
00:50:16.720 if you're just building like maybe a service project or utility or anything that does not involve a web front end or
00:50:23.839 a guey front end. The one exception is you might have a CLI. You will still want to select create backend
00:50:31.200 architecture. And then there is a create front-end architecture. If you're only working on
00:50:36.319 a web front end, maybe you're working on a website or maybe you already have a backend REST API and you just want to
00:50:42.400 build the React app to call that REST API. That's where you would say create front-end architecture. And then
00:50:48.720 finally, our friend the brownfield is back. So we can create a brownfield architecture. And again, that's going to involve a lot of the research that the
00:50:55.920 analyst and the PM did to understand your current project. Feed that into the architecture along with some of the
00:51:01.839 challenges of architecting against an existing project. Creating our backend architecture because we are doing what a
00:51:08.720 to-do app only in the CLI. It's just running in the command line for demonstration purposes. So, we'll hit
00:51:14.960 number two. Now, let me give you a tip on working with the architecture. Regardless of what actual IDE or system
00:51:18.000 No text
00:51:23.760 you're using, you want to use the best model you can. I'm showing you that this can be done in the $20 version of Claude
00:51:30.400 Code, but I would recommend, especially on a more challenging architecture,
00:51:35.680 use Opus or whatever powerful model you have because you will get potentially
00:51:41.920 better results. Or do this on the web with Web Gemini. save your credits and then just get into the IDE after we have
00:51:49.119 our architecture. But I actually enjoy doing the architecture here because as you can see yet again
00:51:57.040 we are producing our document in real time as we go section by section. It
00:52:03.200 gave us a sequence diagram. It gave us some highlevel architecture. You know what we're doing with the database, how
00:52:08.400 we're going to handle error handling and global installation and uninstallation process. Do we want to focus on any of
00:52:14.480 these? We can do alternative analysis, stakeholder input, risk assessment, resource impact, user experience impact,
00:52:22.640 technical feasibility, market validation. You know, read what it gave you and think about if any of these make
00:52:29.119 sense or if you want to do any of these. And if not, just move on to the next section. Also, question in this next
00:52:34.960 section what technologies it comes up with. Make sure it knows what the latest
00:52:40.400 versions are or what the best version is. You can also tell it to use the web to make sure that it's considering the
00:52:46.559 latest technologies for everything that it picks is this is going to create a table of all the specific versions and
00:52:52.160 technologies we're using. If you don't have this and tell it what specific technologies, what what testing
00:52:57.520 framework you're using, for example, what'll happen is later on your LLM will be developing. It might be using justest
00:53:04.160 just because it sees that it's already scaffolded and then it'll run into a problem and instead of trying to fix it,
00:53:11.200 it might be sneaky and just try to install a whole new test framework without you noticing. It'll tell it but
00:53:17.359 maybe you're not paying close enough attention or you walk away and you come back and all of a sudden there's a new
00:53:22.720 test framework or there's another new package. And that's because it's not forcing it to stick to any list. When we
00:53:29.440 create this table here and shard this out to a separate document, the dev agent later on will always be aware of
00:53:35.920 this technology stack and will not diverge from it. It's a very powerful technique to make sure your agents are
00:53:42.640 all using consistent libraries, packages, and versions. So, I'm going to go through the rest of the architecture,
00:53:47.839 but just remember section by section you really want to use the advanced solicitation. So let me show you right
00:53:53.440 now just one quick example example and then like I said I'm just going to kind of run through the rest and we'll pick
00:53:58.640 up at the end. So let's say in here doing data models. So this is great because if it makes data models that means later on the agents they'll always
00:54:05.680 conform to the same model. And much like our technology stack you don't want them producing different models on the fly.
00:54:13.440 But let's say for whatever reason I don't understand why we're creating
00:54:19.440 these or I don't like them. So I'm just going to ask a question. And this is one thing you can do. You don't need the
00:54:25.200 prompt here always to ask just ask a question. So say explain to me the interfaces you created and I want an
00:54:31.599 explanation of why each one of them exists and are we missing any? So the architect is programmed to also be very
00:54:38.800 explanatory and explain in a very clear way meeting you at your level. I recommend talking to all these agents.
00:54:46.079 Even if you're not in the middle of a project, you can load up these agents and just talk to them. talk at them talk to them about your ongoing project. What
00:54:52.880 did he tell us? He told us a lot. So, let me explain each type script interface I created and analyze if we're
00:54:58.800 missing any. So, the to-do interface that's obviously important, but why it exists? Type safety. So in other words,
00:55:05.280 an interface allows us to define a object or a par or basically this would
00:55:11.119 be like the blueprint for an object that we will create later and every object must have a task string completed
00:55:19.599 completed at and an ID to make it unique. Um so why does it exist? Type
00:55:25.119 safety. We just talked about that database mapping. So that's interesting. So what that's telling us is he's
00:55:30.480 setting up an interface here that will later also map directly to the SQL light. So we always make sure we have
00:55:36.880 the same properties and fields in our local database. And it's also going to help us define an API contract. The API
00:55:43.280 contract when it returns a to-do is going to be guaranteed with each to-do to return these properties. So if we
00:55:50.799 wanted something else in our to-dos, now would be a good time to add it, not later on when we're developing. So
00:55:56.640 that's again why you want to actually pay attention and try to understand what the architect is telling you. And if you
00:56:01.839 don't, just ask it. And if you read this and you still don't ask it, play five W's with it and ask it why you did this,
00:56:08.880 why you did that, well then why did you do that? Well, why did you do that? And on and on and on. Again, you can learn
00:56:14.799 so much just by engaging in discussions with the architect to really start to
00:56:19.920 learn how software is developed in reality. It's very powerful stuff. All
00:56:25.440 right. Right. And so the uh architecture looks like it is done. We finished the last section. It gave us the final
00:56:32.079 summary and the document is updated. Let's just make sure that everything is in the document. It's pretty large
00:56:38.079 document which is why we shard these documents, but we have our success criteria. Before we shard our documents,
00:56:44.960 just like with the PRD, you really want to go through here and make sure that everything makes sense, such as coding
00:56:51.839 standards. As a matter of fact, coding standards is one of one of the most important ones because this will be used
00:56:57.680 by the developer agent. Directory structure. You want to make sure that this makes sense. If you want to render
00:57:03.359 sequence diagrams, you can just rightclick in VS Code and you can say
00:57:08.559 open preview and then you should be able to see some of these nice looking renders. If you do not have that option
00:57:15.599 in VS Code or in Cursor or Windsurf or whatever you're in, you'll want to go to
00:57:20.640 your extensions, which is this icon here. These are our installed extensions. And you'll want to make sure
00:57:23.000 No text
00:57:26.720 that you have something similar to Markdown all-in-one. I like this one
00:57:32.720 along with Markdown preview mermaid. This will give us mermaid documents or
00:57:38.079 mermaid rendering from this one. And the markdown all-in-one will also let us auto format markdown to make sure that
00:57:44.640 it's valid markdown. Here's our sequence flow. Make sure that the flow makes sense.
00:57:51.599 Here's our database schema. Again, if you don't understand something here, ask it. Ask it why I did this, but this
00:57:58.559 makes sense to me. Here's the source tree that it's going to produce. This controls where the LLM is going to look
00:58:04.480 for files, where it should put them when it creates them. And again, we'll just help it stay on the rail. Having a
00:58:10.799 source tree is a very important document to keeping the LLM on track. I'm going
00:58:16.319 to open up this and I'm going to show you how you can just talk to the agent. In the coding standards, I really want
00:58:21.520 to make sure that the developer agent will use Gab will use good Java do style
00:58:27.680 comments or JS doc style comments on all public functions, public interfaces,
00:58:34.319 etc. So, please add that to the proper section in our architecture under the
00:58:40.160 coding standards. Okay, that was a little bit wordy, but that's why I like using just the uh
00:58:48.079 speech to text because I can kind of work it out in my mind as I'm saying it and usually the LLM can get it right and
00:58:54.960 understand what I'm talking about. But this should now add some documentation standards so we will have good
00:59:00.000 No text
00:59:00.319 consistent documentation. Now, now I'm good with this. Now I think the document is great and we are done here. So now
00:59:05.599 I'm going to close cloud code. I'm going to close all our documents and let's look back at our
00:59:11.839 project. We now have an architecture and a PRD. The two key documents that we
00:59:17.119 need. We don't really need the LLM going forward anymore. Looking at the brainstorming or the brief. Every file
00:59:23.040 that you keep here is potential context that the LLM might choose to load. You can add restrictions. you can tell it
00:59:29.040 not to, but it's better sometimes to add these to another folder. So, you could add these to a project references file,
00:59:36.559 or you could just take them out and store them, or maybe you store them online, depending on how you're organizing your project artifacts. But
00:59:44.079 whatever you do, you don't want them to get pulled in and polluting your context
00:59:49.119 overall. Okay. So, we'll come back to Claude use the shard command. So, if we
00:59:54.240 just type shard, we will see that there's a task shard doc. And do we want to use the MD tree? Yes, we do want to
01:00:00.400 do MD tree. So, okay. So, now it's saying great, the MD tree command is available. If it was not available, it
01:00:06.480 would suggest that you install it. So, now I need to know which documents you'd like to shard. Please provide the path
01:00:12.960 to the document you want to shard. And I'll use the MD tree explode command to automatically split it into smaller
01:00:19.359 documents based on level two sections. So, first of all, we want to do our PRD.
01:00:26.240 So, I'm just going to drag it in there. That's it. And the default should be a folder
01:00:34.000 called PRD, which it is. And look at that. It's already done. That's how quick it is. We now have our epic list.
01:00:41.440 And here is the most important one. Epic 1, epic 2, epic 3 if there were multiple with all of the stories because this is
01:00:47.760 what the scrum master is going to use to build up our stuff for our developer. So, that is great. So now we can say do
01:00:56.000 the architecture and we're just going to drag it in.
01:01:03.440 So as you can see using the BMAD method in cloud code is super easy. We don't have to jump back and forth to the web.
01:01:09.920 It's super powerful and it just does a great great job at following instructions regardless of which model
01:01:16.640 you use in cloud code. Here's our architecture again just in seconds. And now this is the one that is really good
01:01:24.160 to shard because look we have coding standards which has our documentation and some of our other stuff in here that
01:01:29.920 we wanted with examples source tree. So this shows us exactly what our project
01:01:35.200 structure is going to look like. Text deck those three are critical and I want to show you why so you understand this
01:01:40.480 regardless again of which tool you're using. If you go into Claude, since we're using Claude, we'll
01:01:47.040 look at the Claude version. And let's look at what the developer agent has here. The developer agent has a command
01:01:53.680 on here that basically tells it, look at BMAD core, look for the core config.
01:02:02.559 And this is what tells the developer agent what files it will load every time. So the way the developer agent
01:02:07.000 No text
01:02:08.400 works, I've explained this before but I'll say it again. The scrum master is going to take the highle epic and story.
01:02:15.599 It's going to read through various architecture documents. It's going to understand one story at a time and it's
01:02:21.200 going to create a very detailed story for the developer, a lower level
01:02:27.040 developer story. This is a self-contained file for the developer to
01:02:33.440 have all of the context it needs to build the application. We talked a few videos ago ago about
01:02:40.559 context engineering. This is the core of context engineering. Giving the agent
01:02:46.160 exactly what it needs to build its little piece of the kingdom, right? But
01:02:51.520 additionally, not only is all of this information the scrum master is going to put in there
01:02:57.200 exactly what it needs from the architecture and other sources, the developer is always going to load these
01:03:03.520 files that you have listed under dev load always files. By the way, I didn't have to make this myself. This file was
01:03:10.079 created on the install. But if you ever wanted to customize it, maybe there's another file that you always want the
01:03:15.760 dev to load, you can add it here. But again, here's our key documents that were sharded from the architecture, the
01:03:22.880 coding standards, the tech stack, and the source tree. Take your time and really go in there and make updates to
01:03:29.520 those if you need to and change them if any of these things change. All right, we've come a long way. If you're still
01:03:35.680 with me, thank you for sticking with me. If you made it this far, I would love to know who's actually still watching. Um,
01:03:42.319 because I bet this is a very long video. I hope people are appreciating it, though. So, if you've made it this far,
01:03:48.000 how about leaving a comment down below and tell me what is the craziest thing
01:03:53.680 that you want to brainstorm with the brainstorming agent. Give me some of your wildest ideas. And if you actually
01:04:00.319 use the brainstorming agent to do it, come back and tell me one of the craziest things you came up with that
01:04:06.960 you never thought you would come up with before. I would love to hear it. Maybe also jump into the Discord and and talk about your brainstorming adventures. So,
01:04:13.440 as a matter of fact, some people in the Discord actually talked about spending hours just doing brainstorming and
01:04:18.559 coming up with some amazing ideas. We sharted our documents. We have our architecture. We have our PRD. So, that
01:04:26.640 is great. Now, I'm going to do something here. I'm going to create a new folder
01:04:32.000 that I'm just going to call for now temporarily. And I'm going to say get init. put
01:04:38.319 everything in there except for the architecture in the PRD sharded documents. And now I'm going to add agit
01:04:45.119 ignore. So I'm going to say new file.getit ignore. I've added agit ignore file. Please
01:04:52.720 populate it with the common things that should be in a git ignore and also include the ignore folder in the git
01:04:59.760 ignore and the.getit get ignore those files should also generally be ignored
01:05:06.000 by clouds so it won't clutter the context. So there we go. So we just populated a
01:05:13.440 get ignore with a lot of common properties. Now if you're using a starter template or a starter project,
01:05:19.359 it's probably going to set up your git ignore for you. Or if you're using like Nex.js, it'll it'll set that up for you.
01:05:25.359 In a complex project, you would want to use the PO at this point. And the PO has a command called run
01:05:32.400 checklist. And it's going to run the PO checklist. What that does is it's going
01:05:37.760 to look at all of your user stories fresh and it's going to look at the architecture,
01:05:44.400 make sure that they're aligned, make sure that nothing came up in the architecture that needs to feed back
01:05:49.520 into the stories because maybe something changed or if there's any big gaps. It's a really good idea to do that. Sometimes
01:05:56.559 it'll find things, but this is such a simple app and like all of the BMED method, it's adaptable. We do not have
01:06:02.960 to do that step. So, we're going to skip that and we're going to jump right to the scrum master.
01:06:09.920 Now, if you've never used the scrum master, you might not know what it can do. So, as always, I recommend doing /help if it doesn't give you the help
01:06:17.119 commands automatically. Sometimes it will. That's just the nature of LLM
01:06:22.720 sometimes. Um, so we have a few things here. We can draft, which means create the next story. We can do correct
01:06:29.760 course. This is a feature that a lot of people have asked for and don't know exists. Why does my chair keep sinking?
01:06:36.240 Um, correct course is something let's say you've developed, you know, halfway through some of your epics. You're mid
01:06:38.000 No text
01:06:42.079 project in the middle of a story and you realize you forgot something or you want to make a big change. Wrap up what
01:06:49.280 you're doing and then talk to the scrum master or the PM. You can choose either one and run this correct course command.
01:06:56.400 It's going to ask you a bunch of questions and it's going to analyze how far you've gone and whether it's better
01:07:03.280 to, you know, revert back to a certain earlier stage and produce new stories and epics or maybe generate new future
01:07:11.039 stories and epics from where you're at right now. Or your change might be so drastic that it just recommends,
01:07:17.119 although it generally shouldn't, that you start over. But not only is it going
01:07:22.240 to give you these suggestions, it is going to help you. It's going to figure out what epics and stories need to be
01:07:28.160 modified or changed or added or removed so you can do this pivot, account for it, and still get to your end goal.
01:07:35.039 Maybe it means making updates to the architecture or as I said the PRD or
01:07:40.400 maybe you found a new API or a new library that you want to do use, so it might put it in the tech stack. All of
01:07:46.720 that's a possibility with the correct course command. That could be a lifesaver depending on the situation. Of
01:07:52.480 course, it's best to avoid that which is why you go through a lot of planning. What we're looking for here is number
01:07:58.880 one, we want to draft the first story. Now, if you know what story it's time to
01:08:04.799 draft, just tell it. We know we want to do epic one, story one. So, what we can
01:08:11.280 do is we can just say we can say we can say star draft 1.1.
01:08:16.719 So, let's say we're halfway through and it's time to do story 2.3 because story 2.2 finished. You can just tell it draft
01:08:24.399 the next story and it will figure out what the next story is. Or you can tell it which one to do. That'll just make it
01:08:31.359 a little bit more streamlined. It'll go faster and it'll start drafting drafting the story that it needs to. When it
01:08:38.238 drafts a story, it's always going to check if there was a previous story. if there was, it will also check if there's
01:08:44.399 any notes in that story that it needs to carry forward into the new one. A lot of times also these project foundations
01:08:50.719 will have steps in them. So, you really want to read these stories especially and see if there's any human basically
01:08:58.799 things that you need to do. Maybe you need to set up an account or maybe you need to, you know, visit a website and
01:09:04.799 provision some infrastructure that for whatever reason cannot be done by the
01:09:09.839 LLM through a command to the remote service. Maybe you have to get out a credit card and pay for something. Okay,
01:09:15.920 so it's done. Let's look at our story and let's see if it followed the proper template. And it's always going to put
01:09:21.279 it in draft mode. This is standard agile story practice. So as a developer, I want to establish the basic noode.js JS
01:09:28.238 TypeScript project structure so that I have a solid foundation for CLI development. Acceptance criteria means
01:09:35.439 what does it actually take to say yes this story is done and complete. The
01:09:41.198 tasks and the subtasks are going to sound a little bit similar to this a lot of times and it should because these are
01:09:48.158 the actual steps that the developer agent is going to follow step by step to
01:09:54.000 implement our story. This is where the scrum master agent goes through all of
01:09:59.920 the architecture documents, finds information that is relevant to the story and gives it to it here. Since
01:10:06.159 we're doing project setup, the agent needs to know the structure of our project that the architect came up with.
01:10:12.640 So that's why it pasted it here. So the developer agent has this contextual information and doesn't have to search
01:10:18.080 for itself bloating its own context. So there are placeholders where the dev agent can put notes and also where the Q
01:10:24.000 No text
01:10:25.600 agent QA agent can put their notes. Change this to approved.
01:10:32.560 We are done with the scrum master. We're just going to close our context and we're going to start a new one because
01:10:37.840 as always between every step even though we don't have to, it's better practice and it minimizes the overall context.
01:10:44.880 All right. And now we're here in the home stretch. We got James, our full stack developer is locked and loaded.
01:10:52.719 Let's do star help. Now you can just tell James develop a story and it will
01:10:59.120 find the highest numbered story that is set to approved or already in progress that maybe wasn't finished by an
01:11:05.840 instance of himself from before. Or you can just tell him. So why don't we just tell him then he's not having to do the
01:11:11.760 searching. It will just be more uh more streamlined. So we'll say star
01:11:18.880 develop story. We could have also just told it develop
01:11:24.159 story. We could also just say number five. Regardless, I'm just going to hit space. And then I'm going to drag in the
01:11:30.239 file. And now we should finally see our developer implementing story one. I
01:11:37.199 figure let's just do the first story and then we'll commit. But we're just going to say yes, let it do whatever it wants
01:11:42.239 to do. It's setting up our package.json. JSON. And one thing we can do is as it
01:11:47.440 adds the different packages that we need as it's going through the different subtasks. We'll make sure that this is
01:11:53.360 aligned. By the way, we could turn on the unsafe mode for cloud and it would just churn through. But for right now, I
01:12:00.000 No text
01:12:00.480 just have it. I'm sitting here. We're doing this together. I don't mind just telling it yes, continue. If you want to
01:12:05.679 roll the dice, you can turn off all the safety features and let Claude go wild. And look, we're uh we're almost done. It
01:12:12.480 it created a bunch of its own internal to-dos mapped to the actual to-dos in
01:12:18.239 the story. And then we should see that it will actually go through. Now it's starting
01:12:23.600 to check them off. We'll set the status to ready for review. So when it does that, you have two options. I actually
01:12:29.199 recommend doing both, but it depends on the story. If it's a simple story, probably not necessary, but review it
01:12:34.960 yourself. Maybe test out the functionality manually. Check it out. I would start a new context yet again. So,
01:12:41.040 we're just going to exit. We're going to say Claude. And now we're going to use our QA agent, which is quality
01:12:46.880 assurance. So, let's do star help on Quinn. Quinn the QA agent. So, let's do
01:12:52.960 number one. And let's pull in story number one.
01:13:00.960 Now, again, this is a fresh, brand new context. So, it's going to be looking at the story and all of the project source
01:13:07.679 code and other updates that it made to really make sure that it did a good job. So, this is going to this is going to do
01:13:14.400 a pretty good deep examination. This is another place where you might want to use Opus. Maybe even more importantly
01:13:23.120 than when we were doing the development because this is the critical kind of piece that makes sure that the agent
01:13:29.840 didn't go off the rails and stick files in a stupid place. Um, and it looks like it's already uh finding some things.
01:13:36.239 This was obviously a very small setup story. So there's not a lot for the QA to do for the QA to do, but it did find
01:13:43.920 a few things and it gave us uh these compliance checks that it did here or improvements that it made. So this is
01:13:49.199 great, right? I just want to say thank you again. If you stuck all the way through this video and made it through
01:13:54.320 here, you're going to be so far ahead of the game. You're going to be a power user using the BMED and understanding
01:14:01.040 the BMAD method, especially in claude code. I welcome you to come into the Discord forums and give me your shared
01:14:09.360 experience of how it's working for you. Share with the community or if you have questions still ask the community and
01:14:15.520 they'll be happy to help you. I'm sure also it's a great it's a great place. We'll see you next time. My name is
01:14:21.120 Brian. This has been a very long episode on the BMAD code, but I hope it was
01:14:26.159 helpful and also worth waiting for. So, thank you everybody and we'll see you next time.
